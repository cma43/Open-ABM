        To get a quick start, please see our oabm_example.py file. For a fuller introduction, see our Jupyter notebook in the 'Introductory Walkthrough' folder. Also, keep in mind that you may access the source code of any template models under the 'examples' folder.
        
        All current starting models were built by the MESA team. Users are encouraged to explore MESA and its tools after getting started with Open ABM here: https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/master/tutorials/intro_tutorial.html
