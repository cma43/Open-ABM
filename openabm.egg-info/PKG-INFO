Description: # Open-ABM
        
        Open ABM runs on MESA and wraps basic MESA implementations with easy-to-use helper functions. All current models were built by the MESA team. Users are encouraged to explore MESA and its tools after getting started with Open ABM here: https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/master/tutorials/intro_tutorial.html
